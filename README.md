EWS - Calendar

Implements EWS (Exchange Web Services) for calendar items via MODX. Hopefully this will be extended and useful some time later.

You can't connect to your server at all? I had issues with libcurl/7.21 on Apache2 ... curl update might be needed

IMPORTANT: This is pre-alpha, so do not use in any production environment.
